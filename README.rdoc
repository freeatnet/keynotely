== Keynotely

An example app that uses CarrierWave gem and RMagick to receive single 
or multi-frame files from the user, split them accordingly, and show as 
a set of slides of a keynote.

Done as a proof-of-concept, 2 hours of work (from an empty Rails app to the 
current state), may not feature the nicest code or the best application 
design.
